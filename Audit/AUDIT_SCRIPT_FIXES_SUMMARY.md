# Domain Controller Audit Script Fixes - V8.3

## Problems Resolved

### 1. Extended Health Check False Positives
**Issue**: Extended health check was using old `Get-Service -ComputerName` methods that failed and marked all DCs as critical despite DCDIAG tests passing.

**Fix**: 
- Disabled `Test-DomainControllerExtendedHealth` function call (line 710)
- Added comment: `# DISABLED: Causing false positives with old methods`

**Result**: Eliminates false "Service Check Failed, DCDIAG Connectivity Failed" warnings

### 2. Event Log False Alarms
**Issue**: Common benign Windows events (10016, 1008, etc.) were being flagged as critical.

**Fix**: 
- Enhanced benign event ID filtering with comprehensive list
- Added intelligent event severity evaluation
- Only reports truly critical events or multiple concerning events

**Benign Events Filtered**:
- 10016 (DCOM permission issues)
- 1008 (Time service events)  
- 10031 (DCOM configuration)
- 257 (Performance counters)
- 1074 (Planned shutdowns)
- And 16 additional common informational events

### 3. Positive Audit Reporting Implementation
**Enhancement**: Added positive findings to show clients what passed audit checks.

**New Positive Finding Added**:
- **Category**: Domain Controller Health
- **Title**: "Domain Controller Infrastructure Health - All Systems Operational"
- **Evidence**: 
  - Domain Controller Connectivity: Successfully connected to X domain controllers
  - Domain Controller Services: Verified critical AD services running
  - DCDIAG Health Checks: Comprehensive diagnostic tests passed
  - PowerShell Remoting: Successfully established secure connections
