## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel
```bash
# Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
# Common issues:
1. Missing environment variables
2. TypeScript errors (run npm run build locally first)
3. Module not found (check imports)
```

### Tasks Not Importing
```bash
# Check JSON format:
- Must have "tasks" array
- Each task needs "title" field minimum
- Other fields are optional

# Check browser console:
- F12 → Console tab
- Look for error messages
- Check Network tab for API failures
```

### Notes Not Syncing
```bash
# Verify Back4App credentials:
1. Check .env.local locally
2. Check Vercel environment variables
3. Verify Back4App application is active
4. Check Parse Dashboard for errors
```

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Clear browser data:
1. Clear cookies and cache
2. Try incognito mode
3. Check Back4App user exists
4. Verify credentials are correct
```
